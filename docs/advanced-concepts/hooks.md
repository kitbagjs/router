# Hooks

Hooks offer a way to register callbacks on router lifecycle events.  

```ts
onAfterRouteEnter: (to, context) => {
   ...
}
```

## Lifecycle

### Before Hooks

- **onBeforeRouteEnter:** Triggered before a route gets mounted.
- **onBeforeRouteUpdate:** Triggered before a route changes. Specifically when the route changed but that parent or child didn’t.
- **onBeforeRouteLeave:** Triggered before a route is about to be unmounted

### After Hooks

- **onAfterRouteLeave:** Triggered after a route gets unmounted.
- **onAfterRouteUpdate:** Triggered after a route changes. Specifically when the route changed but that parent or child didn’t.
- **onAfterRouteEnter:** Triggered after a route is mounted

## Context

The router provides `to` and a `context` argument to your hook callback. The context will always include:

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| from | What was the route prior to the hook's execution |
| push | Convenient way to move the user from wherever they were to a new route. |
| replace | Same as push, but with `options: { replace: true }`. |
| reject | Trigger a [rejection](/advanced-concepts/rejections) for the router to handle |

See [AfterRouteHookContext](/api/types/AfterRouteHookContext)

If the hooks lifecycle is a [before](/advanced-concepts/hooks#before-hooks) hook, you'll also have access to the following property in your context:

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| abort | Stops the router from continuing with route change |

See [BeforeRouteHookContext](/api/types/BeforeRouteHookContext)

## Levels

Hooks can be registered **globally**, on your **route**, or from within a **component**. This is useful for both providing the most convenient dx, but also can be a useful tool for ensuring proper execution order of your business logic.

### Execution Order

1. Global hooks
1. Route hooks
1. Component Hooks

### Global

```ts
router.onAfterRouteEnter((to, context) => {
  ...
})
```

### Route

```ts
createRoute({
  name: 'Home',
  onAfterRouteEnter: (to, context) => {
    ...
  }
})
```

### Component

In order to register a hook from within a component, you must use the [composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html#composition-api-faq).

```ts
import { onBeforeRouteLeave } from '@kitbag/router'

onAfterRouteEnter((to, context) => {
  ...
})
```

:::warning
You cannot register `onBeforeRouteEnter` or `onAfterRouteEnter` hooks from within a component, since the component must have been mounted to discover the hook.
:::

## Global Injection

Hooks are run within the context of the Vue app the router is installed. This means you can use vue's `inject` function to access global values.

```ts
import { inject } from 'vue'

router.onAfterRouteEnter(() => {
  const value = inject('global')

  ...
})
```
