/**
 * A composition to access the current route or verify a specific route name within a Vue component.
 * This function provides two overloads:
 * 1. When called without arguments, it returns the current route from the router without types.
 * 2. When called with a route name, it checks if the current active route includes the specified route name.
 * 
 * The function also sets up a reactive watcher on the route object from the router to continually check the validity of the route name
 * if provided, throwing an error if the validation fails at any point during the component's lifecycle.
 *
 * @template TRouteName - A string type that should match route name of RegisteredRouteMap, ensuring the route name exists.
 * @param routeName - Optional. The name of the route to validate against the current active routes.
 * @returns The current router route. If a route name is provided, it validates the route name first.
 * @throws {UseRouteInvalidError} Throws an error if the provided route name is not valid or does not match the current route.
 * @group Compositions
